## WinSnap[「Official website」](https://www.ntwind.com/software/winsnap.html)

**WinSnap** is a fast and user-friendly utility for taking and editing screenshots. It easily captures windows of non-rectangular form with transparent backgrounds including Aero Glass and instantly enhances screenshots with professional-looking shadows, reflections, highlights, outlines, watermarks and color effects. Moreover, it allows you to quickly edit and annotate screenshots afterwards.

Packed with a handful of screen capturing and image editing capabilities, WinSnap comes in handy whether you need an occasional screenshot or your job requires professional screenshots for a user manual, presentation, blog or website.

- WinSnap captures screenshots in a much more sophisticated way than other tools, applies customizable effects with no effort and allows you to add comments with just a couple of clicks.

## Built-in Presets for Your Convenience

You can switch between native and custom shadow effects after capture. WinSnap automatically removes native Aero shadow and adds shadow effect of your choice (color, size, direction, opacity).

Built-in presets for shadow and other effects allow even faster editing and customization.

## Support for PNG Transparency and Alpha-Channel

All screenshots created with WinSnap can be saved with transparency. Empty area between windows, popup menus and other objects is filled with transparent background, while shadows and reflections are semi-transparent.

If you have Microsoft Office installed, you can also **copy images with transparency to clipboard** from WinSnap and paste them directly into a Word document, PowerPoint presentation, Outlook email or OneNote.

## Capture Multiple Objects and Regions

With WinSnap, you can simultaneously capture multiple objects (e.g. windows, dialogs, popup menus, buttons and other UI elements) and screen regions. Hold down the CTRL key to select multiple objects in the Object capture mode.
